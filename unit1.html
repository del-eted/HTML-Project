        <h4 class="centerText">The purpose of IT in modern business</h4>
        <p class="centerText">IT is fundamental to modern businesses, as data forms the foundation of modern problem solutions and customer service methods - personal identifiable data, remotely accessed, can allow a customer service agent to remotely access a customers details in real time, and provide direct support, advice and updates (to both customer, the database of information or to a third party, EG, a telephone engineer) while speaking to the customer. This is the basis of call centers, the first point of contact for many businesses and fundamental to many business income generation models in many industries in the UK today.
        <br>The volume of data processed and the speed it is processed at would be impossible for anything but an IT solution to handle - a pure human model would be immensely expensive and operate at a fraction of the speed of an IT dependent model; this can be observed in the largest companies in the world; many of which are IT business, or even data-dependent companies, such as Google, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft and Apple. Industries are being automated by IT solutions - from more popular and familiar examples such as car production factories or modern offices and accounting solutions, to less familiar examples such as spaceflight, design - even pure traditional animation techniques are compiled digitally, and served in a digital format.
        <br>Without IT solutions, such as remote storage, data processing, data storage, remote input, accessible apps, websites and online stores a company in the modern world cannot hope to become and remain competitive, as IT solutions are a part of everyday life with the proliferation of home computers, some in disguise such as smartTVs into our homes and our reliance upon mobile technologies such as laptops and smartphones to help us organise our lives, our data and our schedules.

        <h4 class="centerDiv">Methods and tasks required to successfully complete a digital task</h4>
        <p class="centerDiv">In order to successfully complete a digital project several tools are required - beginning with hardware requirements; modern software require reasonably powerful hardware solutions. This hardware will require an OS to function properly (an expensive investment, and an important decision) as well as a wide suite of software operating on it fit for the task at hand as well - for simple coding you will require a code-writing program, such as VSCode, and for general use a web browser (trusted and reliable browsers such as Opera, Chrome and FireFox), an office suite (Such as the reliable and ubiquitous Microsoft Office), and general operational (often free to use) software - Adobe Flash, SunJava, and others.
                <br>For more specific use, costs can rapidly increase - Adobe Photoshop for image manipulation can become very expensive very quickly, especially with further supporting programs.
                <br>Moving away from software requirements are the logistical support required to complete a project - a project can quickly become complex, and require multiple skill sets to be completed, requiring extensive coordination. For smaller scale projects, such as small-scale app development, this can include the use of online resources, such as organisational tools like Trello, sharing and file repositories for off-site storage, such as GoogleDocs or the more specialised GitHub, which can also help group projects be better centralised and coordinated, or accessed remotely for out-of-hours work, or working from home. These sharing sites require coordination and group efforts to be successful, and for every member of the team to be engaged with and utilise the resources efficiently.

            <h4 class="centerDiv">Plan and execute the task using IT</h4>
            <p class="centerDiv">o complete this task, I will be using Trello to securely and clearly outline particular tasks, and break down objectives and requirements into smaller, more accessible and clearly identified tasks. I will also be compiling data using remote storage on Google Docs, and writing the code using VSCode, stored remotely via GitHub.

            <h4 class="centerText">The risks to a digital projects</h4>
            <p class="centerText">Mid-development updates to dependant libraries or OSâ€™ can negatively impact or even break coded functions, requiring already developed functions to be re-developed. Hardware and software development costs can create limitations in workload capacity, bottle-necking development and further increasing costs.
                    <br>Unexpected loss of data can occur with hardware or sudden power failures that cause unsaved work to be lost, or if off-site data storage suffers failures, or temporary outages that can disrupt workflow. With group projects multiple users editing documents can also lead to duplication or accidental editing errors without proper care or moderating. Data migration can cause a loss of customer data for large projects, or a corruption of data in smaller ones. Data security in third-party storage or remote-access storage can also be a risk during development, leading to security and data leaks that jeopardize the project or even the entire company. Simple security risks such as weak passwords and failing to lock a computer when leaving a workstation can also be a risk to security.
