            <p class="textWhiteBig">1.1 The purpose of IT in modern business</p>
            <p class="textWhite">IT is fundamental to modern businesses, as data forms the foundation of modern problem solutions and customer service methods - personal identifiable data, remotely accessed, can allow a customer service agent to remotely access a customers details in real time, and provide direct support, advice and updates (to both customer, the database of information or to a third party, EG, a telephone engineer) while speaking to the customer. This is the basis of call centers, the first point of contact for many businesses and fundamental to many business income generation models in many industries in the UK today.
            <br>
            <br>The volume of data processed and the speed it is processed at would be impossible for anything but an IT solution to handle - a pure human model would be immensely expensive and operate at a fraction of the speed of an IT dependent model; this can be observed in the largest companies in the world; many of which are IT business, or even data-dependent companies, such as Google, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft and Apple. Industries are being automated by IT solutions - from more popular and familiar examples such as car production factories or modern offices and accounting solutions, to less familiar examples such as spaceflight, design - even pure traditional animation techniques are compiled digitally, and served in a digital format.
            <br>
            <br>Without IT solutions, such as remote storage, data processing, data storage, remote input, accessible apps, websites and online stores a company in the modern world cannot hope to become and remain competitive, as IT solutions are a part of everyday life with the proliferation of home computers, some in disguise such as smartTVs into our homes and our reliance upon mobile technologies such as laptops and smartphones to help us organise our lives, our data and our schedules.

            <p class="textWhiteBig">1.2 Methods and tasks required to successfully complete a digital task</p>
            <p class="textWhite">In order to successfully complete a digital project several tools are required - beginning with hardware   requirements; modern software require reasonably powerful hardware solutions. This hardware will require an OS to function      properly (an expensive investment, and an important decision) as well as a wide suite of software operating on it fit for       the task at hand as well - for simple coding you will require a code-writing program, such as VSCode, and for general use a     web browser (trusted and reliable browsers such as Opera, Chrome and FireFox), an office suite (Such as the reliable and        ubiquitous Microsoft Office), and general operational (often free to use) software - Adobe Flash, SunJava, and others.
            <br>    
            <br>For more specific use, costs can rapidly increase - Adobe Photoshop for image manipulation can become very expensive very quickly, especially with further supporting programs.
            <br>
            <br>Moving away from software requirements are the logistical support required to complete a project - a project can quickly become complex, and require multiple skill sets to be completed, requiring extensive coordination. For smaller scale projects, such as small-scale app development, this can include the use of online resources, such as organisational tools like Trello, sharing and file repositories for off-site storage, such as GoogleDocs or the more specialised GitHub, which can also help group projects be better centralised and coordinated, or accessed remotely for out-of-hours work, or working from home. These sharing sites require coordination and group efforts to be successful, and for every member of the team to be engaged with and utilise the resources efficiently.</p>

            <p class="textWhiteBig">1.3 Plan and execute the task using IT</p>
            <p class="textWhite">To complete this task, I will be using Trello to securely and clearly outline particular tasks, and break down objectives and requirements into smaller, more accessible and clearly identified tasks. I will also be compiling data using remote storage on Google Docs, and writing the code using VSCode, stored remotely via GitHub. Github was particularly useful in testing compatibility via browsers and on multiple platforms - allowing me to access both the code and the frontend UI of the site from home via a Windows OS machine and in the school via a Mac OS machine, allowing me to identify formatting errors visible only on Windows and vice versa - particularly with div fields displaying unwanted errors - different errors on Windows and Mac using the same browser (in both Firefox and Chrome).
            <br>
            <br>VSCode was also useful for this, giving the same UI and UX to edit the code across both OS machines, making edits simple and easy on both Windows and Mac, which was critical to the success of my work and the speed it could be completed.</p>

            <p class="textWhiteBig">1.4 The risks to a digital projects</p>
            <p class="textWhite">Mid-development updates to dependant libraries or OS’ can negatively impact or even break coded functions, requiring already developed functions to be re-developed. Hardware and software development costs can create limitations in workload capacity, bottle-necking development and further increasing costs.
            <br>    
            <br>Unexpected loss of data can occur with hardware or sudden power failures that cause unsaved work to be lost, or if off-site data storage suffers failures, or temporary outages that can disrupt workflow. With group projects multiple users editing documents can also lead to duplication or accidental editing errors without proper care or moderating. Data migration can cause a loss of customer data for large projects, or a corruption of data in smaller ones. Data security in third-party storage or remote-access storage can also be a risk during development, leading to security and data leaks that jeopardize the project or even the entire company. Simple security risks such as weak passwords and failing to lock a computer when leaving a workstation can also be a risk to security.

            <p class="textBlackBig">1.5 How would you select IT systems for a digital project?</p>
            <p class="textBlack">I would select based on a balance of cost, availability and familiarity. PCs fulfil all of these in abundance, but are very difficult to set up in terms of hardware components, especially when compared to their competitors Mac, though the very high costs of macs and limitations of the available software and general unfamiliarity (particularly when compared to the ubiquitous nature of PCs and Windows OS) make these a very specialist choice.
            <br>
            <br>More important than OS is the software that will perform the majority of the project work - many programs are available on both Mac and Windows OS, but certain programs, especially those associated with the Apple family of products, are only available on Mac OS - Xcode for example - and require complex work-arounds to be functional on a Mac OS, thus requiring a Mac to be fully functional.
            <br>
            <br>Fortunately most cloud-based remote storage are HTML based and can be accessed by any web browser, even compatible to mobile devices such as smartphones, and can be used by teams using multiple OS’, or accessed by different devices remotely - if an individual's work station has Mac OS, and home computer has Windows OS for example, enabling cross-platform work to happen easily and seamlessly.
            <br>
            <br>For this project I will be using an in-office Macbook Pro, my home PC for hom edits and cross-platform testing and an Android phone for mobile platform testing.
            </p>
            <p class="textBlackBig">1.6 How have these choices helped you achieve your outcome?</p>
            <p class="textBlack">Trello was very important in my planning process, allowing me to break down tasks and visualise how far from completion any particular task was. If one task proved troublesome or difficult, then separating it into several smaller tasks through Trello allowed it to be tackled in manageable, smaller chunks, ensuring that issues never prevented progress from being made and overcoming mental blocks. Github and Google Docs allowed me to add to my work whenever and wherever inspiration struck, both being easily accessible and documents editable through browsers - allowing access from my phone on the go, or from home on my computer for larger out-of-hours edits. This made working on my project possible at all hours and from any location with a 4G signal (virtually anywhere I’d be likely to end up), making working on it simple, accessible and convenient, easing the creative process.
            <br>
            <br>The ability to write, edit and test code is, of course, entirely reliant on the use of hardware, and access to hardware is fundamental to completion of this project. Using remote storage, though (as discussed earlier) opens up its own risks, also mitigates the risks of hardware failure or software incompatibility by allowing access from any location, and a wide number of devices.</p>

            <p class="textWhiteBig">1.7 Copyright and GDPR</p>
            <p class="textWhite">GDPR stands for “General Data Protection Regulations” and is an EU guideline that came into force on May 25th 2018 relating to data storage and protection. It defines data as; </p>
                    <div class="quote">
                    <p class="textBlackQuote">“any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person—including identifiers such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or, for example, factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person” [<a href="https://www.monterail.com/blog/introduction-to-gdpr-for-digital-companies" target="_blank">1</a>]</p>
                    </div>
            <p class="textWhite"><br>
            It is a guideline for the storage and use of personal data, and gives the right of individuals to see the data stored about them, and even force the cessation of processing of that data. 
            <br>
            <br>For digital companies it also enforces that all processing of personal data must be done with the mind of minimising data - restricting the used information to the bare minimum to restrict the movement of personal data, and thereby help reduce the risks and impact of leaked or lost personal data, including the collecting of unnecessary information, for example, taking an email address for future marketing purposes. One common way of anonymising data, especially for data analysis collection (thus, not requiring it to be compliant with GDPR) is to remove any personal identifiers - IPs, names, addresses, etc, while still collecting sensitive data like date of birth, ethnic origin, income, etc.
            <br>
            <br>The legislation also helps bring foreign competitors operating within the EU (which, in todays modern digital market, means globally) must also comply to EU GDPR. [<a href="https://www.dpnetwork.org.uk/gdpr-data-retention-guide/" target="_blank">4</a>]</p>

            <p class="textWhite">The hardware used had little impact when making the website, as VSCode was used as the text editor for my project and functions identically on Mac and Windows OS, and any modern desktop browser is able to view the website with full functionality. The software used, especially remote access, allowed easy viewing, editing, downloading and uploading of files, and multi-platform testing to be conducted whenever convenient to do so.</p>
            <p class="textWhiteBig">2.2 Were these tools appropriate?</p>
            <p class="textWhite">The hardware used had little impact when making the website, as VSCode was used as the text editor for my project and functions identically on Mac and Windows OS, and any modern desktop browser is able to view the website with full functionality. However, the use of both Windows and Mac OS identified errors in displays that only appeared on one or the other system - a workaround fix using BRs with minimal impact on final formatting solved both these errors, which were caused by interactions between the DIV fields creating the parallax scrolling effect and the way the OS used CSS to render the pages.
            <br>
            <br>The software used, especially remote access, allowed easy viewing, editing, downloading and uploading of files, and multi-platform testing to be conducted whenever convenient to do so. Using a cross-platform text editor (VSCode) that functions identically on both Mac and Windows was fundamental and vital to my work, as I regularly accessed and edited the code (and checked for errors) on both systems - having different access at different times of the day. This also provided the fundamental basis of my compatibility and accessibility testing - my home PC having customised accessibility settings for comfortable viewing, and the Macbook used in office hours having default accessibility settings, allowing me to review and alter the browser altered text settings I used in CSS.
            <br>
            <br>Of particular use would have been a method to view the site using mobile device settings, which may have enabled short term or work-around fixes for the incompatibility of the site with mobile device aspect ratios caused by the backgrounds used. This may, however, simply lend itself to a more permanent and complex fix for that particular problem, which would require more time to fix - but if I were to address that problem in the future I would still require this solution.</p>

            <p class="textWhiteBig">2.3 Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</p>
            <p class="textWhite">The final product works as intended on desktop browsers, but does not function properly on mobile devices, as the images and text used do not scale adequately to the different aspect ratios and the screen resolutions. Despite using CSS code that relies on the default font settings of the browsers used to strengthen accessibility to the site, the text remains small and difficult to read on mobile devices, particularly mobile phones. Therefore a default text size would be a stronger choice for a mobile version of the site.
            <br>
            <br>This reliance on the browsers code however is very helpful when viewing from customised browsers - such as those used from a more comfortably formatted home computer (in particular, my home computer uses larger font sizes so it can be used without my glasses, and the code used adjusts to this automatically without issue).
            <br>
            <br>The site is also built around colour theory principles, giving each page a theme through backgrounds, using similarly grouped and formatted text with off-black and off-white colours selected to help make them easier on the eye, remove visual noise and make them less distracting for the viewer - something discussed in accessibility, but also fits well into modern design aesthetics. I also desaturated the backgrounds used to remove visual noise, bring them closer together thematically and visually, and again remove visual distractions despite the complexity of some of the background images used.
            <br>
            <br>The use of parallax scrolling makes the website look modern and dynamic, and also helps to separate text into what appear to be smaller, more easily readable chunks - a visual trick often used in graphic design for infographic posters and images. This is a fairly simple coding trick, but an important front end decision.</p>

            <p class="textWhiteBig">2.4 Further improvements you could make to your project</p>
            <p class="textWhite">The site could identify the browsers aspect ratio or device used to view the site, and direct to a mobile compatible version of the site using different backgrounds created in vertical aspect ratios specifically for mobile devices, and seperate side-menus rather than a top navigation bar, as is the standard for mobile versions of websites and apps, and use larger buttons for touch-screen use rather than the precision of a mouse.
            <br>
            <br>I also feel that some of the background images used could be improved, given the time to find stronger images (or, for a professional or personal project, create them - to avoid infringement of copyright and also have full control over thematic and colour choices).</p>
            <p class="textWhiteBig">2.5 Is your outcome fit for Purpose?</p>
            <p class="textWhite">My final outcome is fit for purpose as it demonstrates a technical understanding of HTML and CSS, utilising JS, and is visually sleek, professional looking, visually appealing website that is simple and easy to use.
            <br>
            <br>The site uses only readily available file types and code languages to be visible on regular, widely used browsers without relying on plugins. It also takes advantage of CSS using large, x-large and xx-large font sizes to use the browsers customisable built-in viewing preferences to increase site accessibility.</p>

            <p class="textBlack">The use of cloud storage enabled remote accessing and editing of files whenever required, and allowed me to use personal time to find inspiration and add to the site, allowing the addition of some JS to enhance the UX. I personally feel that teamwork may have confused the project, as I relied very heavily on my art school background when selecting fonts, colour palette and fonts, which gave my website a unified and professional finish, which I believe worked very well. If the project called for a larger website, then team work would have been useful, but for such a small website of only a few pages I do not personally feel it would have been beneficial for the final product, especially when viewed from a professional perspective, if the product was delivered timely to a client.</p>
            <p class="textBlackBig">3.2 Describe ways to improve efficiency and productivity</p>
            <p class="textBlack">Using a framework editor rather than manually writing the code out for myself would improve the speed and efficiency of work in digital project - such as a website editing UI - however this can in turn limit creative options, and create a very generic looking final product that may not be suitable for purpose, and lack certain features that require specific code to be written.
            <br>
            <br>For larger projects, team work and specialisation within the team can allow for very efficient work, and very high quality code being written.</p>
            <p class="textBlackBig">3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity</p>
            <p class="textBlack">I feel that I worked my hardest and did some of my best work with this website, specifically my skills and experience in visual arts helped with the frontending of the project to professional standards. On occasion however I failed to use trello to break a task down into smaller solutions, which if I had been working in a team would have impacted the teams ability to understand where I am with my work and to offer assistance. The constant moving from one work station to another while continuing to work also interrupted work flows, and forgetting to push to github on one occasion meant I had to re-do work I had already done.</p>

            <p class="textWhiteBig">3.4 How would you go about testing digital solutions?</p>
            <p class="textWhite">Viewing the website from multiple devices through multiple platforms (mobile via trello, via mobile chrome, windows via firefox, mac via chrome), adjusting aspect ratios and windows to test the effect of rescaling and text-wrap of boxes used. Using each link from each page as it is added and after every edit to ensure functionality. (Lots of ctrl+S f5).
            <br>
            <br>I also used a contained HTML file to test isolated code before combining it into the webpage and separating the JS, HTML and CSS code into their correct files - this was especially helpful with setting up the parallax scrolling, as they functioned in isolation, and then didn’t work (due to syntax errors from moving the CSS code) when seperated. This information was enough to point me in the correct direction to fixing the code which, as you can see, now works.</p>
