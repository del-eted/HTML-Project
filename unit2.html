                <p class="textBlack">The landing page is laid out to be minimalist and look professional and sleek - it is a simple series of DIV boxes containing text - including a jump link to about me, and links directly to unit 1 and unit 2 pages.
                <br>
                <br>It uses parallax scrolling to separate information - a central feature of the entire site - to make it visually more appealing and make the information easier to digest. Unlike unit 1 and unit 2 pages, the backgrounds were selected to reflect a strong, attention-grabbing front page, and the “about me” section has an image I personally liked, the Imperial Aquila from Warhammer 40,000 - appropriate to the content.
                <br>
                <br>The unit 1 and unit 2 pages are both laid out identically, with only the information and visual themes differing. They have a shrinking header that uses JS to trigger on a scroll event and reduce the font size of the header, but remains selectable (and the links clickable) in its reduced size. The separate groups of information are separated within their own DIV boxes, and further divided visually by parallax scrolling DIV code to make them visually appealing and visually separate from one another for the sake of the viewer and ease of access. The images selected are grouped into themes, were edited to be less visually distracting, and have high image resolutions and comparable styles to retain the sleek, professional look. Unit 1 images are all mountain based (and alternate, largely, from light to dark) and unit 2 are all beaches to further separate them visually for the viewer.
                <br>
                <br>Buttons were styled specifically to appear as simple text, but are placed in predictable and clear places for the sake of the viewer, and to retain the professional, minimalistic and modern styling of the site.</p>

                    <p class="textBlack">Copyright effects copyright restraints on websites are based on the concept that while publicly accessible, they are not part of the public domain - everything on the internet unless explicitly stated otherwise is protected by copyright law in whichever country the website is hosted. This includes all images and text - so any use of lifted images and text must fall into fair use exceptions for copyright laws;
                    <br>
                    <br>Common Usage - That an image or phrase is used in common day-to-day life, or has cultural or historical connotations, so that it cannot be protected or considered intangible property. Such examples of this includes most common memes, and words such as “hoover” of Hoover Candy PLC, “google” of Google, and “escalator” of the Elevator Company, words that have fallen into common usage to mean something other than the product the name was taken from.
                    <br>
                    <br>Educational Use - If something is used for educational purposes it is considered fair use, as it is not-for-profit. It is important to remember that if a student work is sold, even while still studying, it is no longer considered educational and would immediately be subject to normal copyright laws.
                    <br>
                    <br>Journalistic and Critical Use - Journalism is not subject to normal copyright laws, and are free to use protected imagery when it is relevant to the news item under discussion (for example, a sample of music from a certain artist when reporting on that artists work). Critical use is the work of critics, and the most controversial element of fair use - critics are free to use copyrighted material when discussing and reviewing a product, but the expectations and application of this are not applied universally to all mediums - in particular online platforms (such as YouTube) offer little to no support for critics who use this element of fair use.

                <p class="textBlackBig">1.6 Ease of Accesse</p>
                <p class="textBlack">It is estimated that between 10-18% of the world's population suffers from some form of disability or serious difficulty with day-to-day functioning. Ease of access grants, well, ease of access of your website (and therefore, your business) to these individuals - a significant percentage even at it lowest bracket. And in modern society with various expectations of simple convenient for those who require additional assistance, providing ease of access builds trust and faith in your brand, and failing to provide it or providing it poorly erodes this trust in your brand to be responsible and caring for its own customers.
                <br>
                <br>There are open-source frameworks and guides available to provide ease of access specifically within webpages, to make ease of access easily accessible. Ease of access is now also built into some OS, starting with Windows 7 - meaning your computer itself will communicate to a webpage that it requires ease of access view settings (enlarged text, for example, or text-to-speech). [<a href="https://curatti.com/web-accessibility/" target="_blank">5</a>]
                <br>
                <br>Ease of access can also take the form of learning difficulties - presenting information in long, “text-wall” formats can be daunting, especially to people with high-functioning learning difficulties or behavioural traits such as mild ADHD, or OCD. To limit this, the way information is presented should be considered - shortening links, or displaying them as clearly labeled, clickable text rather than a full URL, clearly labeled information, broken into digestible chunks and subheadings also helps with this issue (as well as being best practice for general useability).

                <p class="textBlack">Various filetypes are used to express data on websites using HTML - some of these require further programs or plug-ins to open, such as Flash. Others, such as JPG, GIF and AVI can be opened by many browsers without additional support.
                <br>
                <br>Popular audio file types are WAV, MP3 (and related video format MP4) and the older MIDI format, which may still be encountered on specialist websites but is now considered archaic and outdated.
                <br>
                <br>PDF files are often found on websites, and require a plug-in to open as a specialist text file format, often Adobe Reader which is free for personal read-only use, but many other viewers are available - both for desktop and mobile devices - and the format is widely used today, especially for read-only or large text documents.
                <br>MPEG is a popular multimedia file format that allows for steaming of data as soon as it is processed.</p>
