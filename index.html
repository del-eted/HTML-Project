    <p class="textWhiteBig">About me:</p>
    <p class="textWhite">My name is Jonathan Kelly, and I am something of a massive nerd. My background in computing has nothing to do with code, until a few weeks ago when I began attending a coding course at Code Nation.
        <br>
        <br>Before that I had dropped out of college without A Levels due to depression, and later in life this developed into unmanageable anxiety, and for several years dictated the pace of life I lived, and I became a dysfunctional mess of mental and emotional health complications.
            <br>
        <br>In recent years I have fought back against it, seeking the medical support I need to become functional again, and pick my life back up - part of which is attending this course, and finally getting a trade for something I am passionate about. But, as I said, I have no experience with coding. In fact, I went to art school and studied Animation and Illustration, including forays into sculpture, fine art, life art, photography and art history. Illustration was always my passion for art, however. And I don’t paint digitally, I use traditional media.
            <br>
        <br>In my down time, I often play videogames, and I paint tabletop miniatures from Warhammer and Warmachine - which I used to play competitively when I was younger, breaking into the international Iron Gauntlet circuit for Warmachine. I have a recently discovered passion for coding, and a lifelong obsession for innovative problem solving. I am also something of a history and space exploration nut. I used to go shooting, and held a firearms license for a time. I enjoy drawing and painting, reading, writing and I also grow my own fruit in a little garden on my balcony to relax.
            <br>
        <br>I did used to build my own PCs with my brother, and remain interested in hardware components for computers - my previous experience with software in computing related to pseudo-coding triggers within games (If X then do Y) and manually installing mods into games with no official mod support - leaving me with a vague familiarity with computer logic, syntax editing and reading through code files.
            <br>
        <br>Previous work experience is mostly customer service based, especially call centers - work I absolutely hated. Dealing with customers and helping - especially breaking down problems and complaints to find solutions - the culture of the industry, especially for the unskilled and cheap labour pool I was part of - is despicably miserable. The hours are long, the work is repetitive and controlled strictly by middle management, breaks are monitored often down to the second (I had no more than 8 minutes for toilet breaks in a 9 and a half hour day)
            <br>
        <br>It’s time for a better career direction.</p>
